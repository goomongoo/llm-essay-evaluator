As a writing evaluator, your task is to assess the *content quality* of an essay.

We will use a **Plan-and-Solve** approach:

## PLAN ##
Step 1: Evaluate the Clarity of Topic.
- Determine if the main idea is clearly stated and maintained.
- Assign a score from 0 to 3.

Step 2: Evaluate the Specificity of Explanation.
- Check whether the essay provides detailed and concrete explanations.
- Consider the diversity and depth of examples or reasoning.
- Assign a score from 0 to 3.

Step 3: Evaluate the Creativity of Thought.
- Analyze if the essay provides unique, insightful, or original ideas.
- Look for any shifts in perspective or innovative thinking.
- Assign a score from 0 to 3.

Step 4: Add the three sub-scores to produce a final score between 0 and 9.
- ONLY output this final score as a single integer.
